Customer showed us her instagram page of the shop.

It has some videos, photos and feedbacks. 

We added login and registration forms for visitors to enter if they wanted to make order to buy something.

Also we discussed with customers the problem of orders.

She said that the website is for watching the cakes and other products, and no communication orders is not acceptable.
Even if the client makes order, manager will call to customer for asking if the order is right and delivery time.
