-------------------------------------Report for  week1---------------------------------

Our team had a meeting this week at Wednesday. We discussed what we want to create and divide our responsibilities.

We thought about how we will looking for customers.

Luckily we find out the customer in a few days. 

Our customer never have been buying for a website and her requirements was a lot in a front end and a bit on the back. Our site is the cake shop that is located in the couple of cities in Kazakhstan.

We have never seen our customer and all the discussions were made by phone or whatsapp. We decided to start from the front end so that it will be easier to explain and show.

At meeting Ainur, Symbat, Nurbakhyt, Takhmina were present. 

We had very useful week.
