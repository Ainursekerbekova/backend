We have made front-end with bootstrap support.
So that all of the information is on the main screen. 
Exactly menu of the products, featured and latest products, and feedbacks from customers. 

Firstly, we added the video from the store on the front page under the logo. 
Then our customer wanted us to make the menu consisting of five categories. 
And each product should have it's description and cost for one piece and kilogram.


Till the next meeting we need to provide this  to the client for approval
