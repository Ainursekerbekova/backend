--------------------------------Report for week 9----------------------------------------


This week we had an issue with domain and hosting.

When we asked for the hosting django projects manager said that simple hosting is not supporting python, only php.

For supporting django we must buy vds sas hosting which should be paid every month(2k tg/month).
Our customer after thinking a while said that is okay.

We fastly buy domain and hosting on the equhost and after 8 hours we were able to see it on the internet.

Our customer was glad to see it and she liked it.
